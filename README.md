This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data courser through Coursera. The R script, run_analysis.R, performs the following operations:

Set the working directory then download and unzip the dataset
Loads both the training and test datasets
Load feature and activity info
Assign column names to the two data sets
Merges the two datasets
Extract the mean and standard deviation of the two datasets
Convert the activity and subject columns into factors
Create a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
The end result is shown in the file secTidySet.txt.
